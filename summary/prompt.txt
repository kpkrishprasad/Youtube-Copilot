Task:
1. Text Extraction: Extract all the text from the dictionary by accessing the values and combine it together.
2. Summary Creation: Summarize the combined text into around 5 sentences. Ensure the summarized text is concise and within the specified length.
3. Timestamp Mapping: Identify the corresponding timestamps from the dictionary keys. Only include the start time of each interval. You should be focusing on capturing the main ideas not the timely organization of timestamps. 
4. Output: Provide only the following:
    * The selected timestamps.
    * A shorter label in bold for each timestamp with a corresponding emoji (look at label and emoji examples);
    keep in mind that you are only using the label and eomji example as format and you are only creating timestamps
    * The corresponding summarized text for each timestamp. Each summarized text should be a brief phrase less than the length of a sentence.
